<p>You have received an e-mail from a good colleague.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">email</p>
<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing the notebook with your exploratory analysis, the results are really promising! I have some code of my own to compute some statistics. I attached the last version of my program in this e-mail. I think the last version compiled well (I hope) but you may need some dependencies I have in my laptop. I think we can collaborate and do a more in-depth analysis together. Please, send me your current results and I will continue from there. [need some reworking]</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Galileo</p>
</div>
<p>Starting a collaboration by sharing code and analysis by e-mail can be a mess. Most probably, a number of unconnected files, with different versions will appear, and tracking versions and stages will become more a more complicated. We need a tool that help us organize all our files, and make it simple and immediate to share exactly the same files with all your collaborators</p>
<h3>Objectives and scope</h3>

<p>....</p>
<h1 id="introduction-to-git">Introduction to Git<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-git" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h1>
<p>Git is a widely used system (both in academia and industry) for version controlling files and
collaborating on code. It is used to track changes in (text) files, thereby establishing a history of all edits made to each file, together with short messages about each change and information about who made it. Git is mainly run from the command line, but there are several tools that have implemented a graphical user interface to run git commands.</p>
<p>Using version control for tracking your files, and edits to those, is an essential step in making your computational research reproducible. A typical git workflow consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>making distinct and related edits to one or several files</li>
<li>committing those changes (i.e. telling git to add those edits to the history, together with a message about what those changes involve)</li>
<li>and pushing the commit to a remote repository (i.e. syncing your local project directory with one in the cloud)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many benefits of using git in your research project:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are automatically forced into a more organized way of working, which is usually a first step towards reproducibility.</li>
<li>If you have made some changes to a file and realize that those were probably not a good idea after all, it is simple to view exactly what the changes were and revert them.</li>
<li>If there is more than one person involved in the project, git makes it easy to collaborate by tracking all edits made by each person. It will also handle any potential conflicting edits.</li>
<li>Using a cloud-based repository hosting service (the one you push your commits to), like e.g. <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>, adds additional features, such as being able to discuss the project, comment on edits, or report issues.</li>
<li>At some point your project will be published. Github or Bitbucket (or similar) are excellent places to publicly distribute your code. Other researchers can then use git to access the code needed for reproducing your results, in exactly the state it was when used for the publication.</li>
<li>If needed, you can host private repositories on Github and Bitbucket as well. This may be convenient during an ongoing research project, before it is publicly published.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to get an idea about git is simply to start using it. The tutorial below will guide you through the essential steps, with a focus on what is needed for making a project reproducible. There are many additional features of both git and the web-based repository hosting services (like Github and Bitbucket) that are not included here. If you are interested in learning more, the web is filled with information (see some examples below)!</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="set-up">Set up<a class="headerlink" href="#set-up" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h1>
<p>This tutorial depends on files from the course Bitbucket repo. Take a look at the <a href="tutorial_intro.md">intro</a> for instructions on how to set it up if you haven't done so already.</p>
<h2 id="install-git">Install git<a class="headerlink" href="#install-git" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<p>Chances are that you already have git installed on your computer. You can check by running e.g. <code>git --version</code>. If you don't have git, install it following the instructions <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="configure-git">Configure git<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-git" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<p>If it is the first time you use git on your computer, you may want to configure it so that it is aware of your username. This username should match the username you have registered on Bitbucket. This will make it easier when you want to sync local changes with your remote Bitbucket repository.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git config --global user.name &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;
</pre></div>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>If you have several accounts (e.g. both a Github and Bitbucket account), and thereby several different usernames, you can configure git on a per-repository level. Change directory into the relevant local git repository and run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git config user.name &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>This will set the default username for that repository only.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="create-an-account-at-bitbucket">Create an account at Bitbucket<a class="headerlink" href="#create-an-account-at-bitbucket" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<p>If you have not done so already, go to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/">bitbucket.org</a> and create an account.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You can also create an account on another online hosting service for version control, e.g. <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>. The exercises below are written with examples from Bitbucket, but the same thing can be done on alternative services, although the exact menu structure and link placements differ a bit.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-new-git-repository">Create a new git repository<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-new-git-repository" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Login to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> and press the plus button to the left and select <em>Create repository</em>:<ul>
<li>Make sure you are listed as the owner</li>
<li>Add a repository name, e.g. <em>git_tutorial</em></li>
<li>You can keep the repo private or make it public, as you wish</li>
<li>Skip including a README</li>
<li>Make sure Git is selected for version control  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="images/new_repo_bitbucket.png" /></p>
<p>You will now be redirected to the repository page. It is an empty repository, so there is not much to see yet. We want to add some contents (files) to the repository. To do that we will first <em>clone</em> the repository locally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a terminal and <code>cd</code> to a directory where you want to clone your newly created git repository (perhaps make a new directory for this course if you haven't done so already).</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> the directory should <em>not</em> be within the <code>reproducible_research_course</code> directory, since
this is itself a git-tracked directory.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Once you are in your directory of choice, run the following command (just make sure to change <code>user</code> to your Bitbucket username and <code>git_tutorial</code> to your repository name, in case you chose something different):</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://user@bitbucket.org/user/git_tutorial.git
</pre></div>

<p>What will happen now is that the git repository will be cloned (i.e. downloaded) to your computer. You might get a warning that the repository is empty (which in fact is the case).</p>
<ul>
<li>A new directory, <code>git_tutorial</code> (or a different name if you choose so), has now been created, <code>cd</code> into that directory.  </li>
<li>This is a git version-tracked directory. How can you know? Run <code>git status</code>!</li>
</ul>
<p>It will probably return something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>On branch master. Initial commit. nothing to commit (create/copy files and use &quot;git add&quot; to track).
</pre></div>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>If you try to run <code>git status</code> in a non-git directory, it will say that it is <em>not a git repository</em>. The way this works is that git adds a hidden directory <code>.git/</code> in the root of a git tracked directory (run <code>ls -a</code> to see it). This hidden directory contains all information and settings git needs in order to run and version track your files. This also means that your git-tracked directory is self-contained, i.e. you can simply delete it and everything that has to do with git in connection to that directory will be gone.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Remember that git told you "<em>nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track</em>"? Lets do that!  </li>
<li>Copy the following files and directories from the <code>reproducible_research_course/git</code> directory, into your <code>git_tutorial</code> directory:<ul>
<li><code>Dockerfile</code></li>
<li><code>Snakefile</code></li>
<li><code>config.yml</code></li>
<li><code>environment.yml</code></li>
<li><code>code/</code>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you have done that, run <code>git status</code> again. It will tell you that there are files in the directory that are not version tracked by git.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For the purpose of this tutorial, the exact contents of the files you just copied are not important. But you will probably recognize many of them, as they are all files used in the <a href="tutorial_intro.md">MRSA case study</a>. The <code>environment.yml</code> file contains the Conda environment with all the software used in the analysis (see the <a href="../conda/">Conda tutorial</a>). The <code>Snakefile</code> and <code>config.yml</code> are both used to define the Snakemake workflow, that you should recognize from the <a href="snakemake.md">Snakemake tutorial</a>. The <code>Dockerfile</code> contains the recipe for making a Docker container for the analysis, this will be convered in detail in the <a href="docker.md">Docker tutorial</a>. The <code>code/</code> directory contains an R Markdown report that is used in the final step of the analysis (more on this in the <a href="rmarkdown.md">R Markdown tutorial</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Quick recap</p>
<p>We have used two <code>git</code> commands this far:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git clone</code> - to clone a remote repository locally (e.g. from Bitbucket). This is only done the first time you want to download the repository locally.</li>
<li><code>git status</code> - this is a command you should use <em>a lot</em>. It will tell you, amongst other things, the status of your git clone in relation to the online remote repository.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="committing">Committing<a class="headerlink" href="#committing" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We will now commit the untracked files. A commit is essentially a set of changes to a set of files. Preferably, the changes making out a commit should be related to something, e.g. a specific bug fix or a new feature. Our first commit will be to add the copied files to the repository. Run (as suggested by <code>git status</code>):</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add Dockerfile Snakefile
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>git status</code> again! See that we have added Dockerfile and Snakefile to our upcoming commit (listed under "<em>Changes to be committed</em>"). This is called the staging area, and the files there are staged to be committed.</li>
<li>We might as well commit all files in one go! Use <code>git add</code> on the remaining files as well:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add config.yml environment.yml code/
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>git status</code> and see that all files are in the staging area, and that no files are listed as untracked.</li>
<li>We are now ready to commit! Run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Add initial files&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>-m</code> option adds a commit message. This should be a short description of what the commit contains.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>There are some general guidelines on how to write good commit messages. The following points are
often mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
<li>Limit the subject line to 50 characters</li>
<li>Capitalize the subject line</li>
<li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood">imperative mood</a> in the subject line</li>
<li>Wrap the body at 72 characters</li>
<li>Use the body to explain what and why vs. how</li>
</ul>
<p>In the command above we just added a short subject line ("Add initial files"). It is capitalized, less
than 50 characters, does not end with a period, and uses imperative mood (Add!). It is possible to add a
descriptive body text as well, as hinted by the points above. This is easiest done in a text editor. If
you run <code>git commit</code> without the <code>-m</code> flag, git will open the default terminal text editor (can be configured)
where you can write a longer commit message and body.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>git status</code> (yep, again!). It should tell you "<em>nothing to commit, working directory clean</em>".</li>
<li>Now, let's edit a file. Open up <code>environment.yml</code> in your favorite editor, and change the version of bowtie2 to a different value, e.g. <code>bowtie2=2.1</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>git status</code>. It will tell you that there are modifications in one file (<code>environment.yml</code>) compared to the previous commit. This is nice! We don't have to keep track of what files we have edited, git will do that for us.</li>
<li>Run <code>git diff environment.yml</code>. This will show you the changes made to the file. A <code>-</code> means a deleted line, a <code>+</code> means an added line. There are also shown a few lines before and after the changes, to put them in context.</li>
<li>Let's edit another file! Open <code>config.yml</code>and change the line <code>genome_id: NCTC8325</code> to <code>genome_id: ST398</code>. Run <code>git status</code>. Run <code>git diff</code>. If we don't specify a file, it will show all changes made in any file, compared to the previous commit. Do you see your changes?</li>
<li>Ok, we made our changes. Let's commit them! Run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add config.yml environment.yml
</pre></div>

<p>This will add both our files to the staging area at the same time. Run <code>git status</code> and see that the changes in both <code>config.yml</code> and <code>environment.yml</code> are ready to be committed.</p>
<p>But wait a minute! Shouldn't each commit optimally be a specified set of changes? Yes! So we want to make two commits, one for each change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's remove <code>environment.yml</code> from the staging area. <code>git status</code> tells us how to do this: "<em>(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)</em>". So run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git reset HEAD environment.yml
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>git status</code> again. See that now only <code>config.yml</code> is staged for being committed, whereas the changes in <code>environment.yml</code> are tracked by git, but not ready to be commited.</li>
<li>Commit the changes in <code>config.yml</code>:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Change to ST398 for alignment&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Add and commit the changes in <code>environment.yml</code>:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git status
git add environment.yml
git status
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Change bowtie2 version&quot;</span>
git status
</pre></div>

<p>You don't have to run <code>git status</code> between each command, but it can be useful in the beginning while learning what each command does.</p>
<ul>
<li>To see a history of our changes so far, run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git log
</pre></div>

<p>As you can see, each commit is a point in history. The more often you commit, and the more specific you keep your commits, the better (more fine-grained) history and version tracking you will have of your files.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can also try to delete a file:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>rm Dockerfile
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>git status</code>. As you can see, git tells us that the file is deleted, but that the deletion is not committed. In the same way as we commit edits to files, we need to commit a deletion of a file:</li>

<p>Here we used <code>rm Dockerfile</code> to delete the file and <code>git add Dockerfile</code> to stage the deletion. You can also use <code>git rm Dockerfile</code> to do both these operations in one step.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Quick recap</p>
<p>We now added four important git commands to our repertoire:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git add</code> - adds a file so that changes in that file can be committed.</li>
<li><code>git rm</code> - the opposite of <code>git add</code>, i.e. sets a file to be deleted in the next commit.</li>
<li><code>git commit</code> - commits the changes we have staged (by using <code>git add</code> or <code>git rm</code>).</li>
<li><code>git log</code> - shows us the commit history.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="pushing">Pushing<a class="headerlink" href="#pushing" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<p>So far we have just worked locally. A strength with git is that we can add a remote location to push our commits to. In fact, we already have setup such a remote, since we created the repository at Bitbucket and cloned it locally. The idea is that you work and edit your files locally, and commit changes as you go along. At some points, preferably as often as possible, you push your changes to the remote. Your local copy and the remote copy are then in sync. In principle, you can now safely delete your local copy since everything is backed up in the cloud, including the full commit history. This also enables collaboration. Several users can work on their local clones of a given repository and push changes to a common remote location. Let's try this out in practice!</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>git remote -v</code>. This will show you what remote location is connected to your local git clone. The short name of the default remote is usually "<em>origin</em>".</li>
<li>Run <code>git branch</code>. This will show you the name of the current branch. By default this will be "<em>master</em>".</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>We have not mentioned branches yet (it is touched on at the end) but they are a major feature of git. They allow you to have different "versions" of a repository. As an example, during software development it is common to have a release branch containing code that is working correctly, and a development branch containing code with new features and fixes but also potential bugs that have not been fixed yet. Once the development branch is fixed and working, it can be merged into the release branch. End-users will typically use the code in the release branch only.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Now we will push the latest commits to the master branch to our remote origin:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push -u origin master
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>git status</code>. This should tell you that "<em>Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.</em>".</li>
<li>Go to your Bitbucket repository in your browser again and click on Source to the left. You should now see that the files you have locally appear here as well!</li>
<li>Click on <code>config.yml</code>. You will see the contents of the file. Notice that it is the latest version, where we changed "genome_id".</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="images/bitbucket_config_yml.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on Diff, in the upper right corner. You will see the changes made to this file compared to the previous commit.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="images/bitbucket_config_yml_diff.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click History. You will see an overview of the commits involving changes made to this file.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="images/bitbucket_config_yml_history.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click Commits, to the left in the main menu. You will see an overview of all commits made. Click on a specific commit to see the changes introduced by that commit.</li>
<li>Click on the commit that was the initial commit, where we added all the files.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="images/bitbucket_initial_commit.png" /></p>
<p>You can now click on View source in the top right corner. You will now see the files as they were when we first added them. Specifically you can see that the <code>Dockerfile</code> is back, even though we deleted it! Click on Source to the left again to return to the latest version.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Quick recap</p>
<p>We now learned yet another important git command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git push</code> -  to push local commits to the remote repository</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts<a class="headerlink" href="#conflicts" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<p>We will now learn how to manage conflicts. This is important to know, since it will probably happen sooner or later. It can get a bit tricky, but the important thing is not to panic! :)</p>
<ul>
<li>On the Bitbucket web page, click on <code>environment.yml</code> and click Edit. We can now edit this file directly on the web. This is generally not recommended, but we will do it here to demonstrate a point.</li>
<li>Let's pretend that using multiqc version 1.3 did not work. Change the multiqc version to 1.4:  </li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">multiqc=1.4</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Click Commit. Add the commit message: "Update multiqc version to 1.4". Click Commit.</li>
<li>Click Commits to the left to see the commit history, and your latest change at the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have a change in the remote repository that is not yet in our local clone. This could happen for instance if a collaborator of yours committed a change and pushed it to Bitbucket.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go back to your local terminal. Run <code>git status</code>. Notice that git says: "<em>Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.</em>". This is of course not true, but our local git clone is not yet aware of the remote changes. We will get those changes soon.</li>
<li>But first, we will edit <code>environment.yml</code> locally as well! (It may be the case that your collaborator thought it was good to use multiqc version 1.4, whereas you thought it would be better to use multiqc version 1.2, but neither of you communicated that to the other.) Use a text editor and change the multiqc line to:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">multiqc=1.2</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Commit your change (use <code>git status</code> along the way if you want to check what is happening in the different steps):</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git status
git add environment.yml
git status
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Downgraded multiqc to v1.2&quot;</span>
git status
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Now let's try to push this commit!</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push
</pre></div>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Note that after the initial push you probably don't have to specify <code>-u origin master</code>, git will figure that out by itself.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the error message. It should be fairly informative of what is going on. In essence it will not allow you to push since there are conflicting changes made to the remote repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will now download the changes made to the remote:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git fetch
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Now run <code>git status</code>. Unlike before, our local git clone now is aware of the latest changes pushed to the remote. It will tell you something along the lines: "<em>Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commit each, respectively.</em>".</li>
<li>Now, since we ran <code>git fetch</code> our local git has up-to-date information about the status of the remote repository. We can therefore run the following to see what the difference is between the current state of our local clone and the master branch on the remote origin:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git diff origin/master
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Now let's try to integrate the remote changes with our local changes and get up to sync with the remote:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git pull
</pre></div>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Note that you can skip the <code>git fetch</code>command if you want to and run <code>git pull</code> directly. The difference is that <code>fetch</code> will just update git with the latest information of the remote status, whereas <code>pull</code> will try to integrate and sync those changes to your local clone directly.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>As you have probably noticed, the <code>git pull</code> command resulted in a conflict. Git tells us about this and suggests that we should fix the conflicts and commit that.
As always, run <code>git status</code> to get an overview! You will see that you have, so called, unmerged paths and that the conflicting file is <code>environment.yml</code>, since both modified the same line in this file. To fix a conflict, open the affected file in a text editor. You will see that it now looks something like this:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>channels:

<p>The part between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code> and <code>=======</code> is your local version, and the part between <code>=======</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; d9b35ef61d2fde56fcbd64aacb10a96098c67cbf</code> is the one added to the remote and which caused the conflict when you tried to pull those changes to your local repository. The long sequence of characters is the commit id (the first 7 are e.g. displayed on Bitbucket under Commits) which will be different for your repository.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is now up to you to decide which version to keep, or to change it to a third alternative. Let's say that you are confident that it is better to run multiqc v1.2 rather than v1.4. Edit the file so that it looks like you want it to, i.e. remove the lines added by git and delete the line with <code>multiqc=1.4</code>. The final file should look like this:</li>

</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="ignoring-files">Ignoring files<a class="headerlink" href="#ignoring-files" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<p>Git is aware of all files within the repository. However, it is not uncommon to have files that we don't want git to track. For instance, our analysis might produce several intermediate files and results. We typically don't track such files. Rather, we want to track the actual code and other related files (e.g. configuration files) that produce the intermediate and result files, given the raw input data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's make some mock-up intermediate and result files. These are some of the files that would have been generated by the Snakemake workflow if it was run.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkdir intermediate
mkdir results
touch intermediate/multiqc_general_stats.txt
touch results/supplementary.pdf
touch log.tmp
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>git status</code>. You will see that git tells you that you have untracked files. However, we don't want git to track these files anyway. To tell git what files to ignore we use a file called <code>.gitignore</code>. Let's create it:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>touch .gitignore
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Open the <code>.gitignore</code> file in an editor and add the following lines to it:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Ignore these directories:
results/
intermediate/

# Ignore temporary files:
*.tmp
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Run <code>git status</code> again. Now there is no mention of the <code>results</code> and <code>intermediate</code> directories or the <code>log.tmp</code> file. Notice that we can use wildcards (*) to ignore files with a given pattern, e.g. a specific extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go ahead and add, commit, and push the <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Quick recap</p>

</div>
<h2 id="tagging">Tagging<a class="headerlink" href="#tagging" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<p>Git allows us to tag commits. This is of particular importance when it comes to reproducible research. We can tag commits that represent important points in the history of our project. This can be, for example, the version of the repository that was used for the manuscript submission, the version used during resubmission, and, most importantly, the version used for the final publication. The first two examples are mainly useful internally, but the latter is essential for other researchers to be able to rerun your published analysis. Let's try this out!</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's assume that the status of the repository as it is now is ready for a submission to a journal. It may for example contain the scripts that were used to generate the manuscript figures. Let's add a tag:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git tag <span class="s2">&quot;submission1&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>To push this tag to Bitbucket we use:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push --tags
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Go to Bitbucket and check Commits. Can you see that the tag has been added?</li>
<li>Let's assume we now got comments from the reviewers, and by fixing those we had to update our code. Open <code>config.yml</code> and change the line <code>max_reads: 25000</code> to <code>max_reads: 50000</code>. Commit and push that change:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add config.yml
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Increase number of reads&quot;</span>
git push
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Now let's say that the reviewers were happy and the manuscript was accepted for publication. Let's immediately add a tag:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git tag <span class="s2">&quot;publication&quot;</span>
git push --tags
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>After the study was published you realized that you get nicer QC information if you upgrade multiqc. Open <code>environment.yml</code> and change <code>multiqc=1.2</code> to <code>multiqc=1.5a</code>. Add, commit, and push this change:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git add environment.yml
git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;Upgrade to newer multiqc version&quot;</span>
git push
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Go to Bitbucket and click Downloads, and then Tags. Here users can download a compressed file containing the repository at the versions specified by the tags.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="images/bitbucket_downloads.png" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, git users who want to reproduce your analysis with the code used for the publication can clone the Bitbucket repository and then run <code>git checkout publication</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can try this in your local clone, run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout publication
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Open <code>environment.yml</code> and note that the multiqc version now is back to 1.2! To go back to the latest version, run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout master
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Again, open <code>environment.yml</code> and see that it now has version 1.5a!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, you could run <code>git log --oneline --decorate</code> to get a condensed commit history, where you should
also be able to see the tagged commits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Quick recap</p>
<p>We now learned how to tag important commits:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="branching-and-merging">Branching and merging<a class="headerlink" href="#branching-and-merging" title="Permanent link">ïƒ</a></h2>
<p>A more advanced, but commonly used, feature of Git is called branching. Branching allows you to diverge from the main line of work and edit or update your code and files, e.g. to test out a new analysis or some experimental feature, without affecting your main work. If the work you did in the branch turns out to be useful you can merge that back into your main branch. On the other hand, if the work didn't turn out as planned, you can simply delete the branch and continue where you left off in your main line of work. Another use case for branching is when you are working in a project with multiple people. Branching can be a way of compartmentalizing your teams work on different parts of the project and enables merging back into the main branch in a controlled fashion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's start trying out branching! Recall that we can see the current branch by running:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch
</pre></div>

<p>This tells us that there is only the master branch at the moment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's make a new branch:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch test_alignment
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>git branch</code> again to see the available branches. Do you note which one is selected as the active branch? Let's move to our newly created branch:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout test_alignment
</pre></div>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You can create and checkout a new branch in one line with <code>git checkout -b branch_name</code></p>
</div>
<p>Let's add some changes to our new branch! We'll use this to try out a different set of parameters on the sequence alignment step of the case study project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the <code>Snakefile</code> so that the shell command of the <code>align_to_genome</code> rule looks like this (add the <code>--very-sensitive-local</code> option):</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>shell<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;bowtie2 --very-sensitive-local -x &quot;</span> + indexBase + <span class="s2">&quot; -U {input.fastq} &gt; {output} 2&gt; {log}&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Add and commit the change!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To get a visual view of your branches and commits you can use the command:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git log --graph --all --oneline
</pre></div>

<p>We can push the commits in this branch to our remote repository if we want, but one could also choose to just have it locally and then merge it into the master branch when needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyway, let's push it!</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push -u origin test_alignment
</pre></div>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The <code>-u</code> in the command above sets the remote (upstream) tracking to origin for our <code>test_alignment</code> branch. If you would have just typed <code>git push test_alignment</code> git would not know where to push it. However, the next time you push commits to this branch you can simply use <code>git push</code> without the <code>-u</code> since we only need to specify the remote once. Again, you can see your remote locations using <code>git remote -v</code>. You will see it's name (e.g. origin) and URL.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go the the repository at Bitbucket in your browser and see if the new branch has appeared. Under "Source" you can select which branch to view. Can you see the difference in the <code>Snakefile</code> depending on which branch you choose? Under "Commits" you should be able to see the commit history of all branches together with a graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make an additional edit to the <code>Snakefile</code>. To the same line as above, add the <code>--trim5 5</code> flag:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>shell<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;bowtie2 --very-sensitive-local --trim5 5 -x &quot;</span> + indexBase + <span class="s2">&quot; -U {input.fastq} &gt; {output} 2&gt; {log}&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Add, commit and push this change. Remember, you should be able to just use <code>git push</code> now.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is often useful to see what the differences exists between branches. You can use the <code>diff</code> command for this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git diff master --color-words
</pre></div>

<p>This shows the difference between the active branch (test_alignment) and master. Here we add the argument <code>--color-words</code> which should display the difference on a word- rather than line-basis. Do you see that git reports <code>--very-sensitive-local --trim5 5</code> to be the difference between the test_alignment and master branches?</p>
<p>Now, assume that we have tested our code and the alignment analysis is run successfully with our new parameters. We want to merge our work into the master branch. It is good to start with checking the differences between branches (as we just did) so that we know what we will merge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, checkout the branch you want to merge into, i.e. master:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout master
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>To merge, run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git merge test_alignment
</pre></div>

<p>A default merge commit message appears. Close the terminal editor (e.g. ctrl + X if Nano or :wq, Enter if Vim). Run <code>git log --graph --all --oneline</code> again to see how the merge commit brings back the changes made in test_alignment to master.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>When merging it is not uncommon to encounter merge conflicts. This can happen e.g. if work has continued on the master branch that is in conflict with the test_alignment branch (in this example). Handle these conflicts in the same manner as was described above.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>If working on different features or parts of an analysis on different branches, and at the same time maintaining a working master branch for the stable code, it is convenient to periodically merge the changes made to master into relevant branches (i.e. the opposite to what we did above). That way, you keep your experimental branches up-to-date with master and make them more easy to merge into master when time comes.</p>

<ul>
<li>If we do not want to do more work in test_alignment we can delete that branch:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git branch -d test_alignment
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Run <code>git log --graph --all --oneline</code> again. Note that the commits and the graph history are still there? A branch is simply a pointer to a specific commit, and that pointer has been removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above command only deleted the local branch. If you want to remove the branch from the remote repository as well, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git push origin --delete test_alignment
</pre></div>

<p class="admonition-title">Quick recap</p>
<p>We have now learned how to divide our work into branches and manage those:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git branch branch_name</code> - create a new branch</li>
<li><code>git checkout</code> - update files to match the versions in the given branch or tag name</li>
<li><code>git merge</code> - to merge one branch into another</li>
</ul>
